# php-laravel-resume
In this repository, I will be adding code for a php website using laravel framework. This website is nothing but kind of my resume. It will showcase my php knowledge and I will be able to learn some basics of laravel in it. Also, someone who visits this website, they will get to know about me, my skills, projects that I have worked on till now.
